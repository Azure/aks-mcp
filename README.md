# AKS-MCP

The AKS-MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants
to interact with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. It serves as a bridge
between AI tools (like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other MCP-compatible AI
assistants) and AKS, translating natural language requests into AKS operations
and returning the results in a format the AI tools can understand.

It allows AI tools to:

- Operate (CRUD) AKS resources
- Retrieve details related to AKS clusters (VNets, Subnets, NSGs, Route Tables, etc.)
- Manage Azure Fleet operations for multi-cluster scenarios

## How it works

AKS-MCP connects to Azure using the Azure SDK and provides a set of tools that
AI assistants can use to interact with AKS resources. It leverages the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) to facilitate this communication, enabling AI tools to
make API calls to Azure and interpret the responses.

## Azure CLI Authentication

AKS-MCP uses Azure CLI (az) for AKS operations. Azure CLI authentication is attempted in this order:

1. Service Principal (client secret): When `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables are present, a service principal login is performed using the following command: `az login --service-principal -u CLIENT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET --tenant TENANT_ID`

1. Workload Identity (federated token): When `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` environment variables are present, a federated token login is performed using the following command: `az login --service-principal -u CLIENT_ID --tenant TENANT_ID --federated-token TOKEN`

1. User-assigned Managed Identity (managed identity client ID): When only `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is present, a user-assigned managed identity login is performed using the following command: `az login --identity -u CLIENT_ID`

1. System-assigned Managed Identity: When `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY` is set to `system`, a system-assigned managed identity login is performed using the following command: `az login --identity`

1. Existing Login: When none of the above environment variables are set, AKS-MCP assumes you have already authenticated (for example, via `az login`) and uses the existing session.

Optional subscription selection:

- If `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` is set, AKS-MCP will run `az account set --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_ID` after login.

Notes and security:

- The federated token file must be exactly `/var/run/secrets/azure/tokens/azure-identity-token` and is strictly validated; other paths are rejected.
- After each login, AKS-MCP verifies authentication with `az account show --query id -o tsv`.
- Ensure the Azure CLI is installed and on PATH.

Environment variables used:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY` (set to `system` to opt into system-assigned managed identity)

## Available Tools

The AKS-MCP server provides consolidated tools for interacting with AKS
clusters. Some tools will require read-write or admin permissions to run debugging pods on your cluster. To enable read-write or admin permissions for the AKS-MCP server, add the **access level** parameter to your MCP configuration file:

1. Navigate to your **mcp.json** file, or go to MCP: List Servers -> AKS-MCP -> Show Configuration Details in the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. In the "args" section of AKS-MCP, add the following parameters: "--access-level", "readwrite" / "admin"

For example:
```
"args": [
  "--transport",
  "stdio",
  "--access-level",
  "readwrite"
]
```

## How to install

### Prerequisites

1. Set up [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticate:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

### VS Code with GitHub Copilot (Recommended)

#### 🚀 One-Click Installation with the AKS Extension

The easiest way to get started with AKS-MCP is through the **Azure Kubernetes Service Extension for VS Code**.

#### Step 1: Install the AKS Extension

1. Open VS Code and go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
1. Search for [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-aks-tools).
1. Install the official Microsoft AKS extension.

#### Step 2: Launch the AKS-MCP Server

1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search and run: **AKS: Setup AKS MCP Server**.

Upon successful installation, the server will now be visible in **MCP: List Servers** (via Command Palette). From there, you can start the MCP server or view its status.

#### Step 3: Start Using AKS-MCP

Once started, the MCP server will appear in the **Copilot Chat: Configure Tools** dropdown under `MCP Server: AKS MCP`, ready to enhance contextual prompts based on your AKS environment. By default, all AKS-MCP server tools are enabled. You can review the list of available tools and disable any that are not required for your specific scenario.

Try a prompt like *"List all my AKS clusters"*, which will start using tools from the AKS-MCP server.

Note:
For VS Code that is runing inside of WSL environment, starting AKS MCP server could fail with error "Connection state: Error spawn /home/path/.vs-kubernetes/tools/aks-mcp/v0.0.3/aks-mcp ENOENT", it means VS code cannot find this file. The resolution is modifying the mcp.json file as following to make it running with wsl.

```json
"AKS MCP": {
	"command": "wsl",
	"args": [
		"<aks-mcp path>",
		"--transport",
		"stdio"
	]
}
```


> **💡 Benefits**: The AKS extension handles binary downloads, updates, and configuration automatically, ensuring you always have the latest version with optimal settings.

#### Step 2: Configure VS Code

After downloading, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace root with the path to your downloaded binary.

##### Option A: Automated Setup Script

For quick setup, you can use these one-liner scripts that download the binary
and create the configuration:

*Windows (PowerShell):*

```powershell
# Download binary and create VS Code configuration
mkdir -p .vscode ; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Azure/aks-mcp/releases/latest/download/aks-mcp-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "aks-mcp.exe" ; @{servers=@{"aks-mcp-server"=@{type="stdio";command="$PWD\aks-mcp.exe";args=@("--transport","stdio")}}} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3 | Out-File ".vscode/mcp.json" -Encoding UTF8
```

*macOS/Linux (Bash):*

```bash
# Download binary and create VS Code configuration
mkdir -p .vscode && curl -sL https://github.com/Azure/aks-mcp/releases/latest/download/aks-mcp-linux-amd64 -o aks-mcp && chmod +x aks-mcp && echo '{"servers":{"aks-mcp-server":{"type":"stdio","command":"'$PWD'/aks-mcp","args":["--transport","stdio"]}}}' > .vscode/mcp.json
```

##### Option B: Manual Configuration

> **✨ Simple Setup**: Download the binary for your platform, then use the manual configuration below to set up the MCP server in VS Code.

#### Manual VS Code Configuration

You can configure the AKS-MCP server in two ways:

**1. Workspace-specific configuration** (recommended for project-specific usage):

Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace with the path to your downloaded binary:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "aks-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<enter the file path>",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. User-level configuration** (persistent across all workspaces):

For a persistent configuration that works across all your VS Code workspaces, add the MCP server to your VS Code user settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
2. Search for "mcp" in the settings
3. Add the following to your User Settings JSON:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "aks-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<enter the file path>",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Load the AKS-MCP server tools to Github Copilot

1. If running on an older version of VS Code: restart VS Code i.e. close and
   reopen VS Code to load the new MCP server configuration.
2. Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
3. Click the **Tools** button or run /list in the Github Copilot window to see the list of available tools
4. You should see the AKS-MCP tools in the list
5. Try a prompt like: *"List all my AKS clusters in subscription xxx"*
6. The agent will automatically use AKS-MCP tools to complete your request

> **💡 Tip**: If you don't see the AKS-MCP tools after restarting, check the VS Code output panel for any MCP server connection errors and verify your binary path in `.vscode/mcp.json`.

**Note**: Ensure you have authenticated with Azure CLI (`az login`) for the server to access your Azure resources.

### Other MCP-Compatible Clients

<details>
<summary>Docker and Custom Client Installation</summary>

For other MCP-compatible AI clients like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/), configure the server in your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aks": {
      "command": "<path of binary aks-mcp>",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 🐳 Docker MCP Toolkit

You can enable the [AKS-MCP server directly from MCP Toolkit](https://hub.docker.com/mcp/server/aks/overview):

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Click "MCP Toolkit" in the left sidebar
3. Search for "aks" in Catalog tab
4. Click on the AKS-MCP server card
5. Enable the server by clicking "+" in the top right corner
6. Configure the server using "Configuration" tab:
   - **azure_dir** `[REQUIRED]`: Path to your Azure credentials directory e.g `/home/user/.azure` (must be absolute – without `$HOME` or `~`)
   - **kubeconfig** `[REQUIRED]`: Path to your kubeconfig file e.g `/home/user/.kube/config` (must be absolute – without `$HOME` or `~`)
   - **access_level** `[REQUIRED]`: Set to `readonly`, `readwrite`, or `admin` as needed
7. You are now ready to use the AKS-MCP server with your [preferred MCP client](https://hub.docker.com/mcp/server/aks/manual), see an example [here](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/#install-an-mcp-client).

On **Windows**, the Azure credentials won't work by default, but you have two options:

1. **Long-lived servers**: Configure the [MCP gateway](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-gateway/) to use long-lived servers using `--long-lived` flag and then authenticate with Azure CLI in the container, see option B in Containerized MCP configuration below on how to fetch credentials inside the container. 
2. **Custom Azure Directory**: Set up a custom Azure directory:
    ```powershell
    # Set custom Azure config directory
    $env:AZURE_CONFIG_DIR = "$env:USERPROFILE\.azure-for-docker"
    
    # Disable token cache encryption (to match behavior with Linux/macOS)
    $env:AZURE_CORE_ENCRYPT_TOKEN_CACHE = "false"
    
    # Login to Azure CLI
    az login
    ```

   This will store the credentials in `$env:USERPROFILE\.azure-for-docker` (e.g. `C:\Users\<username>\.azure-for-docker`),
   use this path in the AKS-MCP server configuration `azure_dir`.

You can also use the [MCP Gateway](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-gateway/) to enable the AKS-MCP server directly using:

```bash
# Enable AKS-MCP server in Docker MCP Gateway
docker mcp server enable aks
```

Note: You still need to configure the server (e.g. using `docker mcp config`) with your Azure credentials, kubeconfig file, and access level.

#### 🐋 Containerized MCP configuration

For containerized deployment, you can run AKS-MCP server using the official Docker image:

Option A: Mount credentials from host (recommended):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aks": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "--user",
          "<your-user-id (e.g. id -u)>",
          "-v",
          "~/.azure:/home/mcp/.azure",
          "-v",
          "~/.kube:/home/mcp/.kube",
          "ghcr.io/azure/aks-mcp:latest",
          "--transport",
          "stdio"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

Option B: fetch the credentials inside the container:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aks": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "ghcr.io/azure/aks-mcp:latest",
          "--transport",
          "stdio"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

Start the MCP server container first per above command, and then run the following commands to fetch the credentials:
- Login to Azure CLI: `docker exec -it <container-id> az login --use-device-code`
- Get kubeconfig: `docker exec -it <container-id> az aks get-credentials -g <resource-group> -n <cluster-name>`

Note that:

- Host Azure CLI logins don’t automatically propagate into containers without mounting `~/.azure`.
- User ID should be set for option A, orelse the mcp user inside container won't be able to access the mounted files.

### 🤖 Custom MCP Client Installation

You can configure any MCP-compatible client to use the AKS-MCP server by running the binary directly:

```bash
# Run the server directly
./aks-mcp --transport stdio
```
